# Nextjs Template

[Nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) already provide a very easy way to use react to create a universal app. However, there are still much to setup if you want to put your app to a production environment. I have spent some time myself to come up with a project template which is able to suit my business needs.

This project template is actually a simple universal webapp with 2 screens. I hope it will be a useful example for those who are interested to build your next webapp with Nextjs.

## Highlights

- a project skeleton on [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) SSR supported React framework

## Getting Started

To create a new app with create-next-app:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest sample-nextjs --use-npm --example "git@github.com:brainmadrovl/nextjs-template.git"
```

To run this example, simply do:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
